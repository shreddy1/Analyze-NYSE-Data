# Analyze-NYSE-Data

In this project, I worked with New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
dataset that contains fundamental financial data for 500 companies.
This dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse). 
Since the dataset is too big, I created a smaller subset of the data.

I used Excel spreadsheet to analyze and summarize the data using
statistics and data visualizations. I also designed a dashboard
that calculates the financial metrics and auto populates the income
statement for each company using data validation and advanced
lookup tools within Excel. A forecast financial metrics dashboard has been made
within the Income Statement, based on three scenarios with distinct
assumptions for a company of my choice from the NYSE dataset.
